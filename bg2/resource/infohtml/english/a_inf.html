Drilled and trained in European fashion and equipped with French Charleville muskets and bayonets,
 the Continental Soldiers are most effective in firefights over short distances and bayonet charges,
 and are the only American troops that can take on the British in a pitched battle. After a bad start,
 these troops, over the course of the war, evolved into an effective, well-disciplined force that won 
the grudging admiration of its enemies.
