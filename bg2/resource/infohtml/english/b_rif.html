Recruited from professional hunters (Jaeger is German for hunter) and trained in light infantry tactics, these German troops,
armed with accurate rifles and short swords, are ideal skirmishers and marksmen, but will
have to rely on the protection of regular infantry at close range, due to their slow-loading weapons
and lack of bayonets. Historically, these troops were rated very highly by the British who employed them and demands for more were frequently made to the German princelings who provided them.
