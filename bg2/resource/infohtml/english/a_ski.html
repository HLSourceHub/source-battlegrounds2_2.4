Unlike continental soldiers, who fought under the more centralized 
control of the Continental Congress, local militia soldiers 
and "minutemen" were controlled by state or local governments 
and served to defend those places, as they were available to be 
called to action quickly to defend their homes. Militia units also 
served as auxiliary forces to Continental troops. They were generally 
more mobile, though not at as well-trained as Continental Army units. 
The Minuteman/Militia class in Battlegrounds 2 reflects this: he is 
faster than regular line infantry and equipped more for shooting than for melee. 
He carries a French-made 1777 model musket and a belt axe from the farm.
