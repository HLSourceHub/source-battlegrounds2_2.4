Joining the battle from America's western frontier are Britain's native tribal 
allies. These fierce and proud warriors have been trained in a mix of ancient 
tribal traditions and also in the use of flintlock muskets. Many of these
warriors who take up the hatchet against the rebels come from the Mohawk tribe, 
as well as four of the Six Nations of the Iroquois. These warriors fight to 
protect their traditional lands from the westward encroachment of the Americans, 
as well as to gain favor and trade from the British. The native class in 
Battlegrounds 2 reflects history: he moves quickly through the battle in 
traditional warrior dress. He wields a traditional native war tomahawk for melee, 
but he also carries a modern British Brown Bess musket for shooting.
