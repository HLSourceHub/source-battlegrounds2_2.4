Armed with a land pattern musket and a bayonet, the British Infantry excel at 
close-range firefights and bayonet charges, but are less well-suited for skirmishing.
This initially proved a severe disadvantage in the rough terrain of the American colonies,
but just as the Americans improved their effectiveness in pitched battle over the course of
the war, the British forces, through new training and improvisation, became quite adept skirmishers.
