Equipped with both  quick-loading pistols and sabres, and unencumbered by heavy gear or longarms,
 the British officers have the versatility to reinforce their men wherever they should falter in the
 face of the enemy and lead them to victory. Service as a commissioned officer in the 
 King's forces was a common and widely used way for young English aristocrats to 
distinguish themselves.
