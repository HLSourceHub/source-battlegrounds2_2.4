Equipped with both a pistol and a sabre, and unencumbered by heavy gear or longarms,
 the officer has the versatility to reinforce his men wherever they should falter in
 the face of the enemy and lead them to victory. The Continental Officer corps was 
comprised of men from many different backgrounds, and early in the war some were even 
elected by the men under their command.
