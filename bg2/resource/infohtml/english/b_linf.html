British Light Infantry supplemented regular heavy infantry
 and played the role of skirmishers against the Continental
 Army and state militias. Armed with a Brown Bess Carbine, the
 light infantry is speedier than heavy infantry, allowing them to
 attack with buckshot or roundball, and then fall back to renew their
 attack later in the battle. They are especially effective at harassing 
American troops, creating a diversion and softening the enemy while heavy
 infantry deals the final blow to the rebels.
