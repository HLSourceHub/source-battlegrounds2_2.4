Modify however you like, just cred me for my work, maybe link to my page.

I made the tga's into vtf and vmt so they could be used in Source mapping.
Just open the zip and put the skybox folder into your mod directory/materials folder.
Example: 
C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\Username\counter-strike source\cstrike\materials\skybox
or
C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\Username\half-life 2 deathmatch\hl2mp\materials\skybox

If the skybox folder exists already just place the files inside this download into your skybox folder.
